# GoDaleks

A modern Go/Ebiten (and faithful) recreation of the classic Mac game **Daleks**, itself inspired by Johan Strandberg‚Äôs 1984 _Daleks_ and the older BSD UNIX game _Robots_.  
This version keeps the spirit of the original while adding smooth animations, mouse support, and modern gameplay tweaks.

## üìú Background

_"Daleks Forever"_ was originally written by Mike Gleason in 2010 as a tribute to the Mac classic, featuring smooth Dalek movement, advanced gameplay tweaks, and faithful sound/graphics.  
The Go/Ebiten edition you see here is a modern port designed to run cross-platform on today‚Äôs systems, preserving the tension and strategy that made the game addictive.

For the history of the original and its Macintosh versions, see [About Daleks Forever](About%20Daleks%20Forever.txt).

## üéÆ Gameplay

The player is a lone human on a grid, hunted by deadly Daleks.  
Daleks move one step per turn toward you. Survive by making them crash into each other, creating scrap heaps, or by destroying them with your **Sonic Screwdriver**.

**You win a level** when all Daleks are destroyed.  
**You lose** if a Dalek catches you.
